# Design Patterns

### The computing scientist's main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.
	
    - E. W. Dijkstra
	
	
* Common design problems as arising from "conflicting forces"
* A design pattern is not invented it's discovered as a repeated solution to a commonly recurring problem
* Is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise
* Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

<br>
    Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.
