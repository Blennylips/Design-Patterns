# Classification of Design Patterns


## Creational
* Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms; create objects in a manner suitable to the situation
* Abstract Factory, Lazy Initialization, Singleton, etc
<!--
AF == hide obj creation details
LI == defer costly init
S  == control obj creation; one only
-->

## Structural
* Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities
* Adapter, Decorator, Facade, etc
<!--
A == wrapper
D == add obj functionality w/o mod src
F == Simplify interface
-->

## Behavioral
* Patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns
* Command, Observer, Template Method, etc
<!--
C == encapsulate info to call method later
O == publish / subscribe
T == algo design w/ abstract steps
-->
