# (more) Vocabulary of Design Patterns

## Cohesion

* A measure of how strongly-related or focused the responsibilities of a single module are

## Coupling

* The degree to which modules rely on each other

## Inheritance

* A way to reuse code of existing objects, establish a subtype from an existing object

## Interface

* A tool and concept that refers to a point of interaction between components

## Polymorphism

* The ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form

.notes: interrelated/trade offs, eg: less cohesion -> more coupling
